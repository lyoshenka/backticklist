## Contributing

I don't run this regularly. The time it was last updated is at the bottom of the list page. If it's been a while, ping me and I'll refresh the data. Or you could fork the repo, run refresh.php and make a pull request. Either way works.

If you can figure out how to make this work using the Javascript API, that would be sweet. But I couldn't get around the rate limiting without a token and I don't want people to have to make a Github token just to see the list.
